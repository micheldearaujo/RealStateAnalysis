# Finding the best place to live - A study of the Real State Market in Brazil

In this project, we are going to analyse data from Brazilian Real State market. The objective is to find the relations between 
house properties, such as number of bathroom, number of bedrooms, area and geolocation, and the renting price.

#### Summary of the results

1. Number of bedrooms and bathrooms alone say little about the pricing of a property. Or at least they don't have a linear relationship to price.
2. The monthly rent values for houses and apartments are statistically different when compared to one-bedroom properties.
3. When we made a scatter plot on the map of Brazil, we saw that most of the homes listed on the Zap Im√≥veis website are concentrated in the capitals, with a greater weight for the Southeast region.
4. And more!
